    content: "It has always been great to take classes with Diya ma'am. We have been studying with her since class 8 (3+years). She is polite and sweet when speaking. As we were not good speakers, she organised multiple debate activities and made us confident. She includes various examples to explain things in a simple and unique way.üíñ Once she taught anything, it was nearly impossible to forget. Diya ma'am always wanted our benefit over her and took late night and early morning classes during exam time. Our grades were low but only in one month we started scoring 90%+ in English papers. Our grammar always got 10/10. WE WOULD RATE HER TEACHING 5+/5",

She is a great teacher and she has a unique way of teaching her students. I have gained my English marks from 18/40 to 39‚Öï/40 in both English Grammar and Literature. She is very polite and motivational towards her students. I would rate 5/5.",

    content: "Learning with Diya has been a great experience for me! I started to learn French as a leisure activity. But over the course of time, I was fascinated with the language and decided to pursue my Delf A1 level, all thanks to her lucid and fun teaching style. The best part about Diya is she's extremely flexible. Since I'm a working professional and there's a dearth of time during weekdays, we have our classes scheduled on weekends or at times during late nights. She uses games and other interactive mediums to make someone who is completely new to French like me, to comprehend it and converse decently. I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to learn French with a fresh and fun approach. It's completely worth it. J'ai ador√© ce cours avec Diya‚ù§Ô∏è",

My daughter is studying French in school, but was not able to enjoy and understand but after a few lessons only she started enjoying. Now French is not scary for her. All thanks to Miss Diya.",
